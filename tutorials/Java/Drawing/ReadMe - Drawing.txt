Files:  	Drawing.java (The source file containing the actual code)
		Drawing.html (A web page that runs the applet in a browser)
		classes (The classes made from the .java files for the applet)
		Build.xml (The xml file that stores the project information)
		nbproject (The folder that holds NetBeans project info)
		applet.policy (The text file that sets permissions for applets)

Instructions:	If you have NetBeans you will need to open the program and then
		then choose the "File->Open Project" menu option.  Navigate the
		the browser that comes up to the directory where your project
		directory is, then either choose the folder that contains all
		of the folders of your project, or open the project folder and
